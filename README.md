# Modern Data Architecture Exercise for AWS DevOps and Data Engineer
# Megan Dicus

## Background

Your client is a growing startup that has recently begun their cloud migration journey. They've completed the initial phase by migrating data from various on-premises sources to Amazon S3 as flat files (CSV and JSON). The data is currently segregated by customer to maintain isolation, a requirement that must be preserved going forward.

The client now needs a robust cloud-native data architecture that delivers:
1. Efficient data processing and transformation
2. Structured storage for analytics
3. Self-service business intelligence
4. Future ML/AI integration capabilities
5. Continuous data ingestion from client sites

Please outline how you would design and implement this cloud data architecture on AWS, starting with the existing S3 data lake.

## Requirements

### Part 1: Data Architecture Design 

Describe or diagram your proposed data architecture, including:

- Strategy for cataloging and organizing S3 files
- Data processing and transformation approach
- Storage layer organization (raw, processed, analytics-ready)
- Analytics and reporting capabilities
- Monitoring and alerting framework

Explain your design choices and how they address the business requirements, focusing on scalability, reliability, and security best practices.

### Part 2: Infrastructure as Code 

Outline your approach to implementing the core architecture components using Infrastructure as Code, including:

- Data storage resources (S3 organization, databases)
- Compute resources (Lambda, Glue, or other services)
- Analytics resources (Redshift, Athena, etc.)
- IAM roles and security policies

Describe how you would incorporate tagging, error handling, and documentation in your IaC implementation.

### Part 3: ETL Pipeline Implementation with AWS Glue

Provide a concise description of your ETL pipeline strategy using AWS Glue. What are the advantages and limitations of Glue for this use case? How would you address potential challenges?

### Part 4: Analytics and Reporting Solution

Summarize your approach to implementing an analytics solution using AWS services. What key considerations would drive your decisions? What tradeoffs would you evaluate? Which AWS products or services would you leverage and why?

## Bonus Considerations

- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Monitoring and alerting strategy
- Cost optimization approach
- Data governance and compliance framework
- Performance optimization techniques
- AWS Lake Formation integration
- Data lineage and metadata management
